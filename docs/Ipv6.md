## IPv6 Support

The DNS Lookup Tool now supports retrieving both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses for a given domain. This enhancement allows users to obtain a comprehensive view of a domain's IP addresses, including both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.

### How to Use IPv6 Support

To utilize the IPv6 support feature in the DNS Lookup Tool, follow these steps:

1. Run the script and enter the domain name for which you want to perform DNS lookups.

2. When prompted, you have the option to use custom DNS servers. If you choose not to use custom servers, the tool will default to Google's public DNS servers (8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4).

3. The script will then gather information about the domain's availability, DNS propagation status, and DNSSEC validation.

4. As part of the enhanced IPv6 support, the script will now retrieve both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses for the domain.

5. The script will display the retrieved information, including IP addresses, MX records, and more.

### Benefits of IPv6 Support

IPv6 support in the DNS Lookup Tool offers several benefits:

- Comprehensive Information: Users can obtain a complete list of both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses associated with a domain.

- Enhanced Network Analysis: Having access to both types of IP addresses helps users analyze network configurations and identify potential connectivity issues.

- Future-Proofing: As the transition to IPv6 continues, this feature prepares users for the increasing prominence of IPv6 addresses on the internet.

## Example Usage

Here's an example of how you can use the DNS Lookup Tool to retrieve IPv6 addresses:

1. Run the script and enter the domain name, e.g., `example.com`.

2. Choose whether to use custom DNS servers or not.

3. The tool will fetch and display information, including IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, if available.

4. Review the displayed information for insights into the domain's network configuration.

## Conclusion

The IPv6 support in the DNS Lookup Tool provides users with a comprehensive view of a domain's IP addresses, contributing to better network analysis and preparation for the evolving internet landscape.
